### Quentin Devalloir (Postdoctoral Researcher)
Quentin has an MSc in conservation biology with a focus on ecotoxicology. His PhD research focused on how multiple stressors (pollution, nutritional quality) impact the immune response of free-ranging rodents. His research merges experimental, field-based approaches along with mechanistic modeling at the landscape scale to understand the response of wild animals to pollution. His current scientific interests are centered around developing new approach methodologies (NAMS) for the use of animals in scientific research and risk assessment. His project focuses on the modeling of pesticide fate and their impact on biodiversity in vineyard landscapes.

### Lisa Gollot (PhD Student)
Lisa has a background in environmental chemistry and agronomy. Within the course of her MSc studies in ecotoxicology at [AgroParisTech](https://www.agroparistech.fr/en), she joined our team for a 6-month internship focusing on the modeling of individual differences in earthworm growth under different pesticide exposure regimes.  She has started her PhD with us in October 2023 on similar topics.
