### Behavioral and Evolutionary Ecotoxicology

I am a behavioral ecologist interested in how animals cope with environmental changes resulting from human activities. I am currently a researcher at the National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment ([INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/)) within the [EcoSys](https://www6.versailles-grignon.inrae.fr/ecosys/) research unit and the [Sol&Tox](https://www6.versailles-grignon.inrae.fr/ecosys/Personnes/Personnel-Sol-Tox/Scientifiques-Sol-Tox/ROYAUTE-Raphael) team. I focus on how the soil fauna responds to contaminant exposure using a combination of modeling and laboratory experiments. My goal is to develop eco-evolutionary models allowing to understand how soil organisms cope with contaminant exposure and at what costs for soil functions.
