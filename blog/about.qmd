## About me

I am a researcher at INRAE. My primary interests lies in linking ecotoxicological and evolutionary approaches to understand how the soil fauna responds to exposure to contaminants. I am interested in using a variety of modeling tools in order to link contaminant exposure to its effects on organisms' life-history and its consequences on population, community dynamics and soil functions.

## What's on this blog?
This blog is an opportunity for me to explore these different classes of models in the open and hopefully provide some useful tools to the research community.
