    "text": "Effects of Contaminants on Behavioral Variation\nDuring my PhD, I examined behavioral syndrome structure and personality variation in regards to development, sex differences, and effects of human disturbances (e.g. pesticide application) on syndromes and personalities. I showed evidence for changes in behavioral correlations between jumping spider populations from an insecticide-exposed and insecticide-free orchard (Ethology 2014) and that direct exposure to a sublethal dose of organophosphate can have a profound effect on personality differences related to activity and prey capture (Functional Ecology 2015). Finally, I provided a conceptual framework by which effects of contaminant on behavioral variation in wildlife can be better understood (Animal Behavior 2014).\n\n\nPhenotypic Integration among Behavior, Physiology and Life-History Traits\nAs a postdoctoral researcher at NDSU, I focused on how strongly behavior correlates with other trait categories such as metabolic rate (Animal Behavior 2015) or animal constructions (J. Evol. Biol. 2018). Using meta-analyses, I showed that behavioral traits are heritable (J. Heredity 2019) but fail to conform to predictions of a “slow-fast” pace-of-life axis (Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. 2018). I also showed that environmental factors such as diet quality have the potential to profoundly reshape the strength and direction of correlations between behaviors and life-history (Behav. Ecol. 2017; Anim. Behav. 2019)\n\n\nQuantitative Genetics and Evolutionary Constraints of Behavioral Syndromes\nWith collaborators Ned Dochtermann (NDSU) and Ann Hedrick (UC Davis), we investigated how behavioral correlations arise and are maintained in Western Field crickets. We showed that genetic variation in behavior is strongly aligned among isolated populations (Proc. B) and even within different species (J. Evol. Biol.).\n\n\nMovement Ecology and Species Interactions\nSince 2020, I have initiated collaborations with movement ecologists to better understand how individual differences in activity are expressed under natural conditions. These collaborations have shown a high degree of individual differences in the predictability of brown bears (J. Animal Ecol. 2021) and in how ungulate negotiate fence crossing in human-altered landscapes (J. Animal Ecol. 2023). I was also involved with the Nature 4.0 project as a postdoctoral researcher at the Senckenberg Institute. There, I focused on methods for classifying daily activity in bats and forest birds using novel approaches for VHF tracking of vertebrate communities (Methods Ecol. Evol. 2023)."

    "text": "You can download my CV here\nI am currently a researcher at INRAE within the EcoSys research unit where I focus on building eco-evolutionary models of the soil fauna under contamination stress.\nI am a broadly trained behavioral ecologist who uses a combination of empirical, theoretical and statistical approaches to understand how behavioral variation responds to environmental cues and under which conditions such variation impact higher order processes at the population and community levels. A primary interest of my research program is to use theoretical foundations in the field of animal personality to understand the processes by which individuals cope with the increasing pressures resulting from human activities.\nAfter obtaining my Master’s degree in Environmental Sciences at the École Nationale Supérieure Agronomique de Toulouse in France, I set sail for McGill University in Montréal, Canada where I studied how behavioral variation is impacted by insecticide exposure in jumping spiders during my PhD.\nI held several postdoctoral position previously, which fed my broad interests in evolutionary ecology. Past projects included determining the role of the genetics and environmental sources of variation that shape the integration between phenotypic traits (collab. NDSU, UC Davis) and understanding the role of variation in animal movement in ecological processes (collab. SBiK-F, Marburg University, LMU Munich)."

As a result, we have a poor understanding on how fast wild population may adapt and at what costs on their growth and reproduction. Quantitative genetic approaches allow to determine the strength and shape of selection acting on phenotypes via the estimation of selection gradients.\n\n\n\nYet, these approaches are rarely used in ecotoxicological assays due to the difficulty of measuring individual fitness in ecotoxicological assays. Using historical data on nematode adaptation to Uranium exposure, we aim to better understand how contaminant exposure may alter evolutionary trajectories.\nCollaborators: Rémy Beaudouin (INERIS), Benoit Goussen (IBACON)\n\n\n\nBehavioral ecotoxicology of carabid beetles in agroecosystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarabid beetles activity\n\n\n\n\nAlthough effects on growth, reproduction and survival are the most commonly evaluated traits in ecotoxicology, pesticides’ impact on wildlife is not limited to these endpoints alone. By acting on neuro-endocrine systems, pesticides can also alter how individuals perceive their environment and deeply alter their physiology or behavior.\n\n\n\nUsing automated-tracking technology, I aim to build better mechanistic models accounting for the effects of pesticides on behavior using a generalist carabid predator as a model system.\nCollaborators: Colette Bertrand (EcoSys)\n\n\n\nSpatially-explicit modeling of pesticide fate\nA major limitation of current risk assessment for pesticide products is its reliance on a substance-by-substance assessment while neglecting the risk posed by pesticide mixtures. A further complication is that pesticides are typically applied at the landscape scale and successively within and across years. To improve on current environmental risk assessment, new exposure modelling approaches are needed that can better account for the fate of pesticides at the landscape scale and the likelihood of exposure given the ecological characteristics of each species (modes of exposure, dispersal, mobility between different habitats). Spatially-explicit models are powerful tools for achieving this vision as they can help identifying landscape features that are more likely to accumulate pesticide residues and can help infer species or groups of species that are most at risk in a given landscape context according to their ecological characteristics. The aim of this project is to determine how pesticides spread in typical vineyard landscapes accounting for how different the exposure risk for functional groups of organisms (e.g., detritivores, herbivores, insectivores…). We will soon hire a postdoctoral researcher to collaborate with us on these topics.\nCollaborators: Cécile Dagès (LISAH), Marc Votlz (LISAH), Carole Bedos (EcoSys), Pierre Benoit (EcoSys), Colette Bertrand (EcoSys), Olivier Crouzet (OFB), Pierre-François Staub (OFB)\nFunders: Horizon Europe - European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals(PARC) - WP6.4.4: Quantify effects of PPP and other stressors through landscape risk assessment informing on environmental impacts\nFunding Period: 2024 – 2026"

    "text": "As a newly-recruited researcher at INRAE, I aim to model the response of soil fauna to various anthropogenic contaminants with a strong emphasis on pesticide mixtures in agroecosystems.\n\nEco-evolutionary dynamics in soil arthropods exposed to pesticide mixtures\nCurrent risk assessment protocols rely heavily on the assumption that ecotoxicological parameters are fixed at the species level. However, individual differences in critical endpoints and in sensitivity to exposure exist and can influence evolutionary responses. Evidence for altered evolutionary trajectories mostly comes from aquatic systems and studies on model organisms. However, we have much less information in terrestrial systems. The results of such evolutionary processes and their feedbacks on ecosystem services such as carbon recycling represent a major gap in our knowledge. By merging current approaches for bioenergetic modeling for pesticide effects with evolutionary theory, I hope to provide insights on a pressing question regarding the risk assessment of pesticides: How fast can soil organisms adapt to pesticide exposure and at what costs for soil functions?\nProjects: EEWORM\n\n\n\nDirect and indirect effects of pesticides in soil trophic networks\nSoil functions are sustained by a complex network of organisms and biological interactions. Understanding the effects of pesticide use on soil biodiversity requires taking into account the different modalities by which organisms are exposed (contact with soil, ingestion of soil particle or contaminated prey) but also determining the consequences of exposure on the stability of trophic network. This means that testing the consequences of pesticide exposure on soil organisms should emphasize testing procedures with interacting communities of organisms rather than relying on a one-species-at-a-time approach. I aim to explore these issues by comparing bioaccumulation of pesticides in simplified soil trophic networks using a combination of predator (carabid bettles) and detritivores (earthworm, enchytraeids, collembola) species.\nProjects: EPIC\n\n\n\nBehavioral ecotoxicology of soil invertebrates\nThe rise of behavioral ecotoxicology as a discipline has shown that the effects of contaminants on organisms’ behaviors are ubiquitous across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Many contaminants act on the nervous system and can reshape how individuals perceive their environment. This means that classical ecotoxicological assays are limited as they tend to focus on growth and reproduction while ignoring subtle effects on social interactions, predator avoidance or feeding strategies. A further complication is the current integration of so-called “animal personalities” within ecotoxicological assays. Simply put, there is tremendous variation in individual responses to the same pesticide exposure as shown in several studies, including in my own research. This means that extracting population averages for key traits (growth, reproduction, no effect concentrations) may result in predictions that poorly reflect how populations cope with contaminants, especially when taking into account evolutionary effects. By merging behavioral endpoints with current theory on the modeling of contaminant effects on organisms, I hope to provide better tools to understand the long-term effects of contaminants on soil organisms and their ecological functions.\n\n\n\n\nModel organisms\n\nApporectodea caliginosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. caliginosa is an endogeic earthworm common in agroecosystem. They are good models for understanding the effects of pesticide use on soils due to their burrowing behaviors and their key role in organic matter decomposition and soil structuration.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoecilus cupreus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP. cupreus is carabid bettle and an important generalist predator in agroecosystem. It feeds on aphids but also on many soil arthropods, including earthworms.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnchytraeus albidus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE. albidus is a small annelid worm common in coastal sand dunes. They contribute to soil organic matter decomposition and soil structuration through their burrowing behaviors."
