A primary interest of my research program is to use theoretical foundations in the field of animal personality to understand the processes by which individuals cope with the increasing pressures resulting from human activities.\nAfter obtaining my Master’s degree in Environmental Sciences at the École Nationale Supérieure Agronomique de Toulouse in France, I set sail for McGill University in Montréal, Canada where I studied how behavioral variation is impacted by insecticide exposure in jumping spiders during my PhD.\nI held several postdoctoral position previously, which fed my broad interests in evolutionary ecology. Past projects included determining the role of the genetics and environmental sources of variation that shape the integration between phenotypic traits (collab. NDSU, UC Davis) and understanding the role of variation in animal movement in ecological processes (collab. SBiK-F, Marburg University, LMU Munich)."

    "text": "Job Description\nA major limitation of current risk assessment for pesticide products is its reliance on a substance-by-substance assessment while neglecting the risk posed by pesticide mixtures. A further complication is that emission sources and contamination routes may accumulate at the landscape scale through successive applications within and across years. To improve on current environmental risk assessment, reference scenarios of biodiversity exposure at the landscape scale are needed. Spatially-explicit models are powerful tools for linking pesticide fate in the environment to species or groups of species that are most at risk in a given landscape context according to their ecological characteristics.Models for pesticide fate in vineyard agroecosystems are under active development at INRAE and allow to simulate the temporal and spatial variation in pesticide concentration in the air, soil and surface water within heterogeneous farmed catchment considering main landscape elements (farmed plot, hydrographic network, some field margins). The aim of this position is to mobilize these tools to determine how pesticides spread in typical vineyard landscapes when accounting for agricultural practices and landscape configuration. These scenarios will be crossed with agent-based models accounting for how different functional groups of organisms (e.g., detritivores, herbivores, insectivores and pollinators) disperse and move in the landscape as exampled in ALMaSS approaches (Animal, Landscape and Man Simulation System)."

As a result, we have a poor understanding on how fast wild population may adapt and at what costs on their growth and reproduction. Quantitative genetic approaches allow to determine the strength and shape of selection acting on phenotypes via the estimation of selection gradients.\n\n\n\nYet, these approaches are rarely used in ecotoxicological assays due to the difficulty of measuring individual fitness in ecotoxicological assays. Using historical data on nematode adaptation to Uranium exposure, we aim to better understand how contaminant exposure may alter evolutionary trajectories.\nCollaborators: Rémy Beaudouin (INERIS), Benoit Goussen (IBACON)\n\n\n\nBehavioral ecotoxicology of carabid beetles in agroecosystems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarabid beetles activity\n\n\n\n\nAlthough effects on growth, reproduction and survival are the most commonly evaluated traits in ecotoxicology, pesticides’ impact on wildlife is not limited to these endpoints alone.

To improve on current environmental risk assessment, new exposure modelling approaches are needed that can better account for the fate of pesticides at the landscape scale and the likelihood of exposure given the ecological characteristics of each species (modes of exposure, dispersal, mobility between different habitats). Spatially-explicit models are powerful tools for achieving this vision as they can help identifying landscape features that are more likely to accumulate pesticide residues and can help infer species or groups of species that are most at risk in a given landscape context according to their ecological characteristics.

    "text": "As a newly-recruited researcher at INRAE, I aim to model the response of soil fauna to various anthropogenic contaminants with a strong emphasis on pesticide mixtures in agroecosystems.\n\nEco-evolutionary dynamics in soil arthropods exposed to pesticide mixtures\nCurrent risk assessment protocols rely heavily on the assumption that ecotoxicological parameters are fixed at the species level. However, individual differences in critical endpoints and in sensitivity to exposure exist and can influence evolutionary responses. Evidence for altered evolutionary trajectories mostly comes from aquatic systems and studies on model organisms. However, we have much less information in terrestrial systems. The results of such evolutionary processes and their feedbacks on ecosystem services such as carbon recycling represent a major gap in our knowledge. By merging current approaches for bioenergetic modeling for pesticide effects with evolutionary theory, I hope to provide insights on a pressing question regarding the risk assessment of pesticides: How fast can soil organisms adapt to pesticide exposure and at what costs for soil functions?\nProjects: EEWORM\n\n\n\nDirect and indirect effects of pesticides in soil trophic networks\nSoil functions are sustained by a complex network of organisms and biological interactions. Understanding the effects of pesticide use on soil biodiversity requires taking into account the different modalities by which organisms are exposed (contact with soil, ingestion of soil particle or contaminated prey) but also determining the consequences of exposure on the stability of trophic network. This means that testing the consequences of pesticide exposure on soil organisms should emphasize testing procedures with interacting communities of organisms rather than relying on a one-species-at-a-time approach. I aim to explore these issues by comparing bioaccumulation of pesticides in simplified soil trophic networks using a combination of predator (carabid bettles) and detritivores (earthworm, enchytraeids, collembola) species.\nProjects: EPIC\n\n\n\nBehavioral ecotoxicology of soil invertebrates\nThe rise of behavioral ecotoxicology as a discipline has shown that the effects of contaminants on organisms’ behaviors are ubiquitous across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Many contaminants act on the nervous system and can reshape how individuals perceive their environment. This means that classical ecotoxicological assays are limited as they tend to focus on growth and reproduction while ignoring subtle effects on social interactions, predator avoidance or feeding strategies. A further complication is the current integration of so-called “animal personalities” within ecotoxicological assays. Simply put, there is tremendous variation in individual responses to the same pesticide exposure as shown in several studies, including in my own research. This means that extracting population averages for key traits (growth, reproduction, no effect concentrations) may result in predictions that poorly reflect how populations cope with contaminants, especially when taking into account evolutionary effects. By merging behavioral endpoints with current theory on the modeling of contaminant effects on organisms, I hope to provide better tools to understand the long-term effects of contaminants on soil organisms and their ecological functions.\nSee also Projects page\n\n\n\n\nModel organisms\n\nApporectodea caliginosa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. caliginosa is an endogeic earthworm common in agroecosystem. They are good models for understanding the effects of pesticide use on soils due to their burrowing behaviors and their key role in organic matter decomposition and soil structuration.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoecilus cupreus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP. cupreus is carabid bettle and an important generalist predator in agroecosystem. It feeds on aphids but also on many soil arthropods, including earthworms.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnchytraeus albidus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE. albidus is a small annelid worm common in coastal sand dunes.

    "text": "Effects of Contaminants on Behavioral Variation\nDuring my PhD, I examined behavioral syndrome structure and personality variation in regards to development, sex differences, and effects of human disturbances (e.g. pesticide application) on syndromes and personalities. I showed evidence for changes in behavioral correlations between jumping spider populations from an insecticide-exposed and insecticide-free orchard (Ethology 2014) and that direct exposure to a sublethal dose of organophosphate can have a profound effect on personality differences related to activity and prey capture (Functional Ecology 2015). Finally, I provided a conceptual framework by which effects of contaminant on behavioral variation in wildlife can be better understood (Animal Behavior 2014).\n\n\nPhenotypic Integration among Behavior, Physiology and Life-History Traits\nAs a postdoctoral researcher at NDSU, I focused on how strongly behavior correlates with other trait categories such as metabolic rate (Animal Behavior 2015) or animal constructions (J. Evol. Biol. 2018). Using meta-analyses, I showed that behavioral traits are heritable (J. Heredity 2019) but fail to conform to predictions of a “slow-fast” pace-of-life axis (Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol. 2018). I also showed that environmental factors such as diet quality have the potential to profoundly reshape the strength and direction of correlations between behaviors and life-history (Behav. Ecol. 2017; Anim. Behav. 2019)\n\n\nQuantitative Genetics and Evolutionary Constraints of Behavioral Syndromes\nWith collaborators Ned Dochtermann (NDSU) and Ann Hedrick (UC Davis), we investigated how behavioral correlations arise and are maintained in Western Field crickets. We showed that genetic variation in behavior is strongly aligned among isolated populations (Proc. B) and even within different species (J. Evol. Biol.).\n\n\nMovement Ecology and Species Interactions\nSince 2020, I have initiated collaborations with movement ecologists to better understand how individual differences in activity are expressed under natural conditions. These collaborations have shown a high degree of individual differences in the predictability of brown bears (J. Animal Ecol. 2021) and in how ungulate negotiate fence crossing in human-altered landscapes (J. Animal Ecol. 2023). I was also involved with the Nature 4.0 project as a postdoctoral researcher at the Senckenberg Institute. There, I focused on methods for classifying daily activity in bats and forest birds using novel approaches for VHF tracking of vertebrate communities (Methods Ecol. Evol. 2023)."

In many cases across ecology and evolution, trends do not go on forever. Having modeling approaches that can account for boundaries and plateaus is therefore very important in specific situations. In my case I’m generally interested in how contamination exposure affects growth, reproduction and behavior of invertebrates and its consequences on individual fitness. In this post I’m exploring how to use nonlinear mixed effect models of growth to recover individual trajectories using simulated data. I’m mostly using the {brms} package for now as it provides a very user-friendly syntax for fitting these models. The level of complexity I’m dealing with is veering dangerously toward a full STAN implementation, especially when I’ll have to deal with jointly modeling fitness, but that’s a problem for future me!\n\n\nInspiration\nA lot of the code in this document has been taken and adapted from Solomon Kurtz’s work and his translation of Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking book into {brms} syntax. Specifically, the simulation of individual differences is directly inspired from working through Chapter 14 section 1.3. Many thanks to them for putting out all this material in an open format!\n\n\nModel description\nI’m using the model described in Goussen et al. (2013) showing adaptation of C. elegans to Uranium. The model assumes nematodes body-length grows according to the following Gompertz function:\n\\[\nL = L_{inf}\\times e^{ln \\left( \\frac{L_0}{Linf} \\right) \\times e^{-\\alpha t} }\\]\nwhere \\(L_{inf}\\) is the asymptotic body-length, \\(L_0\\) is the body-length at hatching and \\(\\alpha\\) the growth rate.\nPlugging in the values from the paper gives a sigmoid growth curve:\n\n\nCode\n# Store parameters for non-exposed populations\nn_id = 10 # 10 individuals\nobs = seq(0, 126, by = 24) # One observation every day\nLinf = 1370\nL0 = 182\nalpha = 0.028\nt = seq(0,126, by = 1) # measure every h for 126 h \nsigma = 100 # random noise\n\nGomp.fun = function(t, Linf, L0, alpha){\n  Lhat = Linf * exp(log(L0/Linf)*exp(-alpha*t)) # predicted growth\n  return(Lhat)\n}\n\n# Apply equation\nset.seed(42)\ndf = crossing(obs, 1:n_id) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Lhat = Gomp.fun(obs, Linf = Linf, L0 = L0, alpha = alpha)) %&gt;% \n  mutate(L = rnorm(n(), Lhat, sigma))\ndf %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(y = L, x = obs)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = .2, size = 2.5) +\n  geom_function(fun = Gomp.fun, \n                     args = list(Linf = Linf, L0 = L0, alpha = alpha),\n                     color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  ylim(0, 1600) +\n  labs(x = \"Hours since hatching\", y = \"Body-length (mum)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimulating individual differences\nWe can use the brms package to make simulations according to some prior distributions for our parameters. We first need to store the values of the growth parameters for each individual\n\nData simulations\nI’m using the same approach as above but now allow individual to have some deviation from the population mean for all parameters: \\(\\mu_i \\sim N(mu + \\text{offset}, \\text{ } \\sigma)\\) where \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\mu_i\\) are the individual and population mean for a given parameter and the offset is calculated as: \\(\\text{offset} \\sim N(0, \\text{ } \\sigma_i)\\) where \\(\\sigma_i\\) is the among-individual standard deviation for a given parameters. In our simulation, we assume a coefficient of variation 10 % for all parameters such that \\(\\sigma_i = 0.10 \\times \\mu\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThere are different ways to interpret the \\(L_{inf}\\) parameter. In Goussen et al’ paper, this was assumed to be the maximum body-size for the population. Meaning that with enough time, all individuals will converge toward this value. Most individuals of course will die before that! Here, I am assuming that all individuals have their own maximum size they can reach. This means that two individuals with the same growth rate measured for the same amount of time may still differ in their maximum length.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nn_id = 30 # 30 individuals\ntimes = seq(0, 126, by = 24) # One observation every day\nsd = 10 # random noise\nL0_mu = 182 # initial length (micrometers)\nLinf_mu = 1370 # maximal length (micrometers)\nalpha_mu = 0.028 # Growth rate (hour^-1)\n\nrho = 0 # Suppose all parameters are independent\n\nmu     = c(L0_mu, Linf_mu, alpha_mu)\nsigmas = c(L0_mu*.1, Linf_mu*.1, alpha_mu*.1) # 10 % CV around the mean\nrho_mat = matrix(c(1, rho, rho,\n                    rho, 1, rho,\n                    rho, rho, 1), \n                    nrow = 3)\n\nsigma = diag(sigmas) %*% rho_mat %*% diag(sigmas)\n\nset.seed(42)\nID = MASS::mvrnorm(n_id, mu, sigma) %&gt;% \n  data.frame() %&gt;% \n  set_names(\"L0_i\", \"Linf_i\", \"alpha_i\") %&gt;% \n  mutate(ID = 1:n_id)\n\n# Simulate individual growth\ndf = ID %&gt;%\n  tidyr::expand(nesting(ID, L0_i, Linf_i, alpha_i), \n                t = times) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Lhat = Linf_i * exp(log(L0_i/Linf_i)*exp(-alpha_i*t))) %&gt;%\n  mutate(L = rnorm(n(), Lhat, sd))\n\nfig.title = df %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(y = L, x = t, group = ID)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = .2, size = 2.5) +\n  geom_line(alpha = .2, size = .5) +\n  geom_function(fun = Gomp.fun, \n                     args = list(Linf = Linf, L0 = L0, alpha = alpha),\n                     color = \"red\", size = 1) +\n  ylim(0, 1600) +\n  labs(x = \"Hours since hatching\", \n       y = expression(paste(\"Body-length (\", mu, \"m)\")))\nfig.title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefining the model in brms\nIn brms, we can use the standard R formula syntax to specify the Gompertz model\n\n\nCode\nbf = bf(L ~ \n           Linf * exp(log(L0 / Linf) * exp(-alpha * t)), # Gompertz population curve\n         L0 + Linf + alpha ~ 1 + (1|ID), # parameters with random effects\n         nl = T)\npriors = get_prior(bf, df)\npriors %&gt;% kable(digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprior\nclass\ncoef\ngroup\nresp\ndpar\nnlpar\nlb\nub\nsource\n\n\n\n\nstudent_t(3, 0, 521.9)\nsigma\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\ndefault\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\nalpha\n\n\ndefault\n\n\n\nb\nIntercept\n\n\n\nalpha\n\n\ndefault\n\n\nstudent_t(3, 0, 521.9)\nsd\n\n\n\n\nalpha\n0\n\ndefault\n\n\n\nsd\n\nID\n\n\nalpha\n\n\ndefault\n\n\n\nsd\nIntercept\nID\n\n\nalpha\n\n\ndefault\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\nL0\n\n\ndefault\n\n\n\nb\nIntercept\n\n\n\nL0\n\n\ndefault\n\n\nstudent_t(3, 0, 521.9)\nsd\n\n\n\n\nL0\n0\n\ndefault\n\n\n\nsd\n\nID\n\n\nL0\n\n\ndefault\n\n\n\nsd\nIntercept\nID\n\n\nL0\n\n\ndefault\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n\n\nLinf\n\n\ndefault\n\n\n\nb\nIntercept\n\n\n\nLinf\n\n\ndefault\n\n\nstudent_t(3, 0, 521.9)\nsd\n\n\n\n\nLinf\n0\n\ndefault\n\n\n\nsd\n\nID\n\n\nLinf\n\n\ndefault\n\n\n\nsd\nIntercept\nID\n\n\nLinf\n\n\ndefault\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are default priors and may not be well-suited for our problem.

However, trade-offs between various life-history traits are also likely to occur. One such trade-off is the compromise between fast growth and reproductive rate, such that individuals that mature sooner reach a smaller asymptotic length.
